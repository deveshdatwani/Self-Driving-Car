# Self Driving Cars Using Raspberry Pi 3 B+

The idea behind this repository is to play around with the concepts acquired through robotics courses and books. For this purpose we use a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and a myriad of different sensors.

### State Estimation and Perception

#### Least Square Method
The ordinary least square method can be deployed on batch readings to estimate the parameter values. 

The basic equation goes like Y(actual) = Y(model response) + e 
 
Ordinary Least Square aims to minimize the error factor accross all the readings and find a solution to the equation.
